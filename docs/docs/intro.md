# Introduction

Welcome to the **Starknet Staking v2** documentation! This validator software is written in Go for Starknet staking v2 as specified in [SNIP 28](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-28-staking-v2-proposal/115250).

## What is Starknet Staking v2?

Starknet Staking v2 is a validator software that enables users to participate in **Phase 2** of Starknet's staking protocol by performing block attestation. Validators attest to randomly assigned blocks during each epoch to prove they are actively tracking the network, which is essential preparation for future phases where validators will have full consensus responsibilities.
