# Starknet Staking v2
Validator software written in Go for Starknet staking v2 as specified in [SNIP 28](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-28-staking-v2-proposal/115250)


## Requirements

- A connection to a [Starknet node or RPC endpoint](https://www.starknet.io/fullnodes-rpc-services/) with support for the JSON-RPC 0.8.0 API specification. For reliability reasons we recommend stakers to host their own nodes. See [Juno](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno) and [Pathfinder](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder).
- An account with enough funds to pay for the attestation transactions.

## Installation

Requires having the [GO compiler](https://go.dev/doc/install) with version `1.24` or above. Once installed run:

```bash
make validator
```

This will compile the project and place the binary in *./build/validator*.

## Running

For executing the validator, just run:
```bash
./build/validator --config <path_to_config_file> 
```

The config file is `.json` which specify two types `provider` and `signer`. For the `provider`, it requires for both an http and ws endpoints are made available with a node that supports rpc version 0.8.1. For the `signer`, you can use the internal provided by this software or one implemented by you.

Depending of the fields `signer` has set, it is stablished as either an internal (provided by us) or external (provided by you) signer. An internal signer has the `operationalAddress` and `privateKey` values set while an external one has the `operationalAddress` and `url` values set. The `url` must point to an address through which validating software and signer will communicate.

A full config file would look like this:

```json
{
  "provider": {
      "http": "http://localhost:6060/v0_8",
      "ws": "ws://localhost:1235/v0_8"
  },
  "signer": {
      "url": "http://localhost:6061/v0_8",
      "operationalAddress": "0x456"
      "privateKey": "0x123", 
  }
}
```

If a signer is defined fully as in the example above, the external signer will take priority.

## External Signer 

The external signer must implement a simple HTTP API, exposing a single `/sign` endpoint:

- POST `/sign`: should return the signature for the transaction hash received as its input:
```json
{
    "transaction_hash": "0x123"
}
```
Response should contain the ECDSA signature values r and s in an array:
```json
{
  "signature": [
    "0xabc",
    "0xdef"
  ]
}
```
An example implementation is provided [here](https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet-staking-v2/tree/main/example-signer/remote_signer.go).

## Additional features

1. Logging

You have the possibility to give an additional flag `--log-level [info/debug/trace/warn/error]` to control the level of logging.
If not set, the log level will default to `info`.

## Example with Juno

Once you have your own node set either built from source or through docker. [See how](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno?tab=readme-ov-file#run-with-docker).

Run your node with both the `http` and `ws` flags set. One example using Juno built from source:

```bash
./build/juno
  --db-path /var/lib/juno \
  --eth-node <YOUR-ETH-NODE>
  --http \
  --http-port 6060 \
  --ws \
  --ws-port 6061 \
```

The configuration file properties will look like:
```json
{
  "provider": {
      "http": "http://localhost:6060/v0_8",
      "ws": "ws://localhost:1235/v0_8"
  },
  "signer": {
      "operationalAddress": "your operational address"
      "privateKey": "your api key", 
  }
}
```
